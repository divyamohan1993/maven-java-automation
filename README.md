# Maven Java Automation

## Purpose of the Project

The Maven Java Automation project is designed to streamline and automate the entire lifecycle of a Maven-based Java application. This project provides an automated solution for compiling, building, and running Java applications without requiring manual intervention, making it ideal for continuous integration workflows and quick development testing.

## How to Use run.sh on Google Cloud Shell

To get started quickly on Google Cloud Shell, you can download and execute the automation script using wget:

### Quick Start Commands:

```bash
# Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divyamohan1993/maven-java-automation/main/run.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x run.sh

# Run the script
./run.sh
```

### Alternative one-liner:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divyamohan1993/maven-java-automation/main/run.sh | bash
```

## What the Script Automates

The `run.sh` script provides complete automation for Maven Java applications:

### Automated Tasks:
- **Compilation**: Automatically compiles all Java source files using Maven
- **Dependency Management**: Downloads and manages all project dependencies
- **Build Process**: Creates executable JAR files with all necessary components
- **Execution**: Runs the compiled Java application automatically
- **Environment Setup**: Ensures proper Java and Maven environment configuration
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages and graceful failure handling

### Benefits:
- Zero-configuration setup
- One-command execution
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Automated dependency resolution
- Quick development iteration
